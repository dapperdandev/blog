## Anatomy
### Builder - The interface (generic)
### Concrete Builder - The implementation
- private product
- (optional) reset method

### Director
### Product

## Misc
- Fluent API

## Resources
- [Harrison Ferrone - C# Design Patterns](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/c-sharp-design-patterns-builder/table-of-contents)

## Notes
- The Director does not return the final result. The director will prepare the the result. The developer still must request the result from the concrete builder
